# Incremental graphs

How to make incremental/layered graphs with ggplot2 for a slideshow

Slides [here](https://weiyangtham.github.io/incremental_slides/incremental_slides.html)

Purpose: for presentations, it can be helpful to build up a figure layer by layer and walk the audience through each element on its own, rather than showing the entire final graph at once.  These [example slides](https://weiyangtham.github.io/incremental_slides/incremental_slides.html) show you how to do that with `ggplot2`.
